RogueLike
=========

A repository for code related to RogueLike development

After a long time, I have revisited this and made the following changes:

* Added a Visual Studio 2022 project with .NET6.0 target framework.
* Cleaned up code
* Fixed a few bugs
* Added efficiencies

The form displays a series of tabs which demo the following classes:

* csCaveGenerator.cs
* csIslandMaze.cs
* csMapbuilder.cs
* FOVRecurse.cs

## FOVRecurse

An implementation of a recursive field of vision alogorithm.

Using QWEASDZXC to move the player around, hold down LMD to draw cells on the map and RMB to delete.
